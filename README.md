# php-notes-simple
 An *actual* super simple note page with markdown support!

 For a more complex and overengineered note page, see https://github.com/Darknetzz/php-notes

Just git clone to your (PHP-supported) webserver and start taking notes. :)

Thanks to https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown for markdown support!
